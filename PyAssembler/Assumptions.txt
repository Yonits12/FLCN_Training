1. The first parameter of 2-parameter operations is ALWAYS in the Register mode (Because of the struct of the first translatd binary word).
2. In general, the addressing mode refers to the LAST parameter of an assembly code line (if any).
3. Branching operations can consist of ALL addressing modes
4. It is allowed to hold some customized labels inside the symbol table (in order to handle arithmetics with labels)
5. There is must be a space 

Future Tasks:
    - In translation func: instead concat in each update - edit array cells then translate at the end.
    - When updating the sym_tbl with new label:
        - insert it's addressing
        - search for any label which has a usage of this very label in it's value, then update it's calculated value.
    - section data strings handling
